The topic of [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) has steadily moved towards the realm of popular science. As with many other topics within popular science, wider audiences will have varying degrees of awareness and depth – but recognition is certainly on the rise.

# Let's get the TV reference out of the way...  
  
While I never got into the TV show, Quantum Leap is still one of the first things that come to mind when I hear quantum computing mentioned. That is until the Bond series displaced it. My first exposure to the topic came from early fascination with high(er) temperature 123 (YBa2Cu3O7) superconductive materials and getting to work as a lab grunt with postdocs that built [SQUIDs](http://digests.fudgesunday.com/issues/virtual-reality-80s-and-90s-nostalgia-41351?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

And yet… a distinct lack of computing references overall but that surface
table scene was pretty slick even for just over a decade ago.  
  
# The Flavor Flav of Emerging Technologies  
  
Almost 20 years ago, Gartner placed quantum computing on their hype cycle.
While many entries on the Gartner Hype Cycle for 2000 are now de rigueur,
quantum computing is still situated on the far far left.

Gartner Hype! circa 2000  
  
For example, consider that Gartner also listed “Synthetic Characters” next to
quantum computing. Today, “Synthetic Characters” are better known as the
dystopian proof-of-concept known as “deep fakes” that many futurists claim
will leave the uncanny valley of visual Fibonacci-esque fluid pattern
recognition of faces.  
  
# The Rest of the World  
  
Trying to gauge more general interests outside of Gartner clientele is a bit
more challenging. Even Google Trends indicate that interest in quantum
computing has risen and fallen over the years.  
  
![Perhaps the least scientific way to gauge interest...](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/004/310/522/mail/Screenshot_from_2019-03-03_21-23-52.png?1551669965)

Perhaps the least scientific way to gauge interest...  
  
Zeitgeist estimates aside, the steady uptick in searches for quantum computing
would indicate more people wonder what quantum computing is about. Also, in
just over 15 years, the interest in quantum computing has risen to the level
of demand for summaries targeting CIOs.

# The Anticipation of Commercialization  
  
Several companies have already appeared to market and associate with quantum
computing. Notably, there is a stead progression of attempts to differentiate.

# Two Different Goals: US and Europe  
  
Back in the US, the race to be a leader in quantum computing solidified in two
ways.

First, the National Quantum Initiative Act was signed into law. Second, AWS telegraphed potential plans via their blog by recognizing the importance of the past 8 years since they announced [AWS QC2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-qc2-the-quantum-compute-cloud/?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for April Fool’s Day 2010.

The future involves “free” 2 Day Delivery of Quantum Computer in a cardboard
box?  
  
However, in Europe, there are initiatives to harness quantum computing for
purposes that will challenge not only nation state surveillance actors but
also the platform implications for global consumer advertising juggernauts. In
the wake of GDPR, if the secrecy solution is successful the nature of B2C
aggregation could get very interesting and have far reaching implications to
our notions of privacy and the expectations in the near future.

# 2019 Brings Differentiation Double Down  
  
If there is a theme for quantum computing in 2019, the theme is
differentiation by adopting maturity oriented marketing terms. For example,
there are already references to systems as well as architectural enhancements
and developer oriented communities – and it’s only March!

Birds of a feather, partners, and the wisdom of self-selecting crowds aching
to become a community aligned to the funding and long term bets of a cloud
computing powerhouse.
