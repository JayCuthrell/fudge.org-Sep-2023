This week I made the pilgrimage to Las Vegas for Dell Technologies World and
had the chance to take a lot of car services but none were via the sixteen
(16) registered taxicab companies serving Las Vegas. Let’s take a look at
ride-sharing in the city of sin and what is likely to be the future of getting
around in just a few years.

The trend is lots and lots of red...  
  
Trending Down
=============
  
No matter what metric, the trends are all heading down for traditional taxi
services in the Las Vegas area. From from the signage to the size of loading
areas it was clear this week that transportation network companies (TNCs) were
disrupting taxis at every turn.

Disruption will arrive in the form of a sedate sedan.

Brief Interruptions  
===================
  
It was only a few years ago that lawsuits and threats were the last refuge of
the taxi companies. Time and technology was not on the side of the taxis.

Just a few years ago, the primary coverage highlighted all the challenges and
ignored the inevitable erosion of established market share.  
  
During the early years of TNC arrival in Las Vegas, the only option for Uber
pickup at the airport was as follows:

  1. stand in line for the the rental car bus
  2. take the bus to the rental car center
  3. upon exiting the bus walk a block 
  4. cross the intersection to the gas station
  5. summon an Uber (and hope)
  6. hopefully find shade at the gas station while you wait

The battle for access to McCarran International Airport is now just a footnote
in history.  
  
The days of a complete geo location blocking screen for summoning an Uber is
left to the history of those that saved screenshots.  
  
Need a Lyft?

C.R.E.A.M. is real. Get that hustle.  
====================================
  
The other interesting finding on this trip is just how dominant Lyft seems to have become in Las Vegas. Almost all my rides during the week were Lyft. In fact, if you want a referral code – For $15 in ride credit, download the Lyft app using my referral link: [https://www.lyft.com/ici/JAY34875](https://www.lyft.com/ici/JAY34875?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
