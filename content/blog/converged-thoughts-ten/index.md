# Computation and Kicks

Sometimes I read published research from Google. Admittedly, it‚Äôs often
(usually?) way over my head. Sometimes I‚Äôll find a familiar area and learn a
bit more about an area that I have brushed up against in my past.

Literally standing on the shoulders of giants (of research)  
  
# Simulation is Good for the Sole  
  
When I went to college in the early 1990s it was for materials science and
engineering. Back in those days, you could buy tennis shoes that would last
longer than the fashion statements they made.

One area of materials science and engineering is the study of polymeric
systems. Plastic? Yep. But there‚Äôs more to polymers than just plastic. You
contain polymers, such as, DNA.

I remember grad students that studied polymers. Everyone on campus had access to DECstations (and uhm... [QBATCH](http://www.tworoads.net/~srp/batch/systems.html?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#qbatch)) , Mac SE‚Äôs, and sometimes Windows 3.1 towers that would have IEEE or other cards to interface with LabView and the like. Some of those grad students even used computers as part of their research for the purposes of simulation. 

One common approach to computational physics is the Monte Carlo method. Back
in those days, what you would think of as high performance computing (HPC) was
probably a trip up the road to see the Cray... unless you had a SLIP account... 
but I digress.  
  
# GNU Shoes  
  
Simulation tools have come a long way since the mid 1990s. In fact, there are
even open source options when it comes to getting your feet wet or committed
to hard edged research.

Fun reading material.  
  
Google Research has done interesting work and published quite a bit of
material on how they use various algorithms (like Monte Carlo, et al) and
combinations of techniques to extend the body of knowledge in everything from
networks to so-called deep learning. Reading their published materials is a
real treat and a testament to how Google gives back to the wider scientific
computation community as well.  
  
# Tread a Fine Line  
  
So, how would one see the convergence in shoes and computational simulations
of polymeric systems? Well, block copolymers are very interesting. You can
think of them like customized polymers that open various design options due to
their unique properties.

If you‚Äôve bought a pair of sneakers recently then you know the prices are
approaching levels of... well... they are getting spendy! Those sneakers are also
highly collectible and valuable as well.

Unfortunately, our material world does not last forever. As such, the fashion
that does not last may be reflected in the pricey sneakers that also do not
last. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. So, it stands to reason that this
market is going to get really really feisty as well.

# Cool Running  
  
First, imagine having access to top notch block copolymer researchers with deep understanding of how to leverage computational modeling and simulation to make the PERFECT set of kicks. Oh, and [these reserachers know where to go for their high performance computing (HPC) needs](http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/learn/high-performance-computing?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Yes. I‚Äôm biased. ü§ì  
  
Next, imagine that you can create a collectible and highly sought after pair
of sneakers for a market that seeks a guaranteed set of unique properties and
you have the means to control production and set price. And what if they
lasted a long time too and your investment was protected from premature
degradation? Pretty cool, right?

Here‚Äôs where the convergence comes into focus on the consumer experience once
again. Imagine going from your wish of perfect kick to your actually shipped
overnight perfect set of kicks. Convergence in this instance will be an
example of ‚Äúit just works‚Äù.

Finally, imagine that you get to pick specific attributes from the block
copolymer that will form your shoes ‚Äì and you aren‚Äôt just picking from A, B,
C, or D options... you get full sliders to control the just in time allocation
of the copolymerization itself! You will truly have custom made long life
shoes in every sense of the process.

We‚Äôre not that far away from that possibility and the first steps towards this
converged path are only a few clicks away. ALl the remains is the will to
satisfy the growing demands of sneakerheads around the world.
