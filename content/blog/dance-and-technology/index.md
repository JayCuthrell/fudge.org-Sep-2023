I’m rebooting this newsletter for 2019. If you forgot you were on this list,
there is probably a GDPR way to get off the list. Enjoy the first (13?)
installment of Fudge Sunday.

Newsletters and podcasts galore  
  
Since attempting a newsletter years ago, I’ve decided to try again.

My last attempt turned in a dozen entries and I attempted to convert them
(badly) into blog posts. But, they were not blog posts.

Lately I’m listening to a smaller number of podcasts but the one podcast that
has been consistent is a16z.

Good stuff.  
  
I also tried reading multiple newsletters. Everyone I listen to or read online
eventually recommends Stratechery but I can’t seem to get into it. I tried the
Stratechery podcast too – but, like the site and newsletter, I failed to get
it. To each their own…

YMMV.  
  
Another writer with a regular newsletter is M.G. Siegler. His writing is
consistently thought provoking and it’s also found on Revue.

Blogging. 20 years later.  
  
I blogged twice this year already and it wasn’t even a new years resolution.

Looking back on the past 20 years of blogging  
  
While I wasn’t blogging over the past 20 years, I was probably trying out just
about every tool online. That included social networks – the successful ones
and the other kind. Like… Google+ (plus?)

Lessons from a Googe+ data export  
  
While me blogging heavily again may not become a trend, I’m planing to get a
newsletter out each Sunday. That trend starts with this installment of the
newsletter. Thanks for reading!  
  
Dance and Technology  
====================
  
If you had told me that dance and technology could collide in the future, I
would probably have assumed it was something relating to anti-gravity or
bionics. Nope. It was a collision in the legal realm.  
  
Back in 2015, the topic of dance choreography was playing out…

What are the copyright rules when it comes to choreography? Who owns what
dances, and how are they licensed?  
  
Now, fast forward to 2019 and the world is almost turning into a scene out of
“Looker” by Michael Crichton from the 1980s which is (no spoilers) literally
the scenario of cutting the artist out of the cost equation.

Waaaaay ahead of its time.  
  
As it turns out, the kid I remembered dancing on a soda pop commercial with
the king of pop is embroiled in a dystopian deleterious dance deliberation!

I had to Google flossing. True story.  
  
And…. scene?

The essential tech news of the moment. Technology’s news site of record. Not
for dummies.  
  
One Last Thing...  
  
Speaking of the 80s… here’s another dancing related video that has all the
ingredients of similar dance moves captured in a novel format and uploaded to
YouTube – which is also no stranger to legal debates.

Very 1980s.
